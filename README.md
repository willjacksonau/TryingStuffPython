The goal for this repo is to create a scalable python project that can be used as a reference for other projects.

Steps:
    1. Add comments to anything learned or not straight forward commands code etc
    2. Seperate script files and test files
    3. Use pytest to create tests
    4. Automate with makefile to run tests etc
    5. Refactor and make sure everything is easy to reference for future projects
